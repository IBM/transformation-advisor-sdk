# Transformation Advisor SDK

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.ibm.ta.sdk/ta-sdk/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.ibm.ta.sdk/ta-sdk)

This is a tool to help a developer to create and build a middleware data collection plug-in, which can be used to gather the information of an application deployed on a middleware server, and provide modernization help and recommendations.  

### Modules

name| description
--- | ---
ta-sdk-spi | Interface of the plug-in framework
ta-sdk-core | Default implementation of SPI framework
ta-sdk-sample | Sample plug-in

### Guide for Plugin Developer
If you want to develop your own plugins using TA SDK,  See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GettingStarted.md) to get start.

### Dependency
Other middleware plug-in project will depend on the ta-sdk-core module.

Need to add this in your pom.xml file.
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.ibm.ta.sdk</groupId>
            <artifactId>ta-sdk-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
ta-sdk-core module will depend on the ta-sdk-spi module.

### Build
This project need to use JDK 11 or above to build.

This project uses Maven version later than 3.6.0 to build. Download and configure Maven before building this project.

On all platforms, build by running this command:
```bash
mvn clean install -Pdev
```
Output archive files can be find in target/ directory.

### Run data collector
To run the data data collector:
```
cd target
java -jar ta-sdk-sample-1.0.0.jar help
```

The `help` command shows the usage for the data collector. The usage information for `middleware` shows the list
middleware based on which plug-ins are in the classpath. In the example below, only 1 middleware/plug-in, `sample`, 
is available:
```
Middleware:
  Plug-ins available for these middleware [ middleware ]
```
The `<middleware> help` command shows the command usage for that middleware.
```
java -jar ta-sdk-sample-1.0.0.jar middleware help
```

You can run all the stages of the sample plugin using the `run` option and 1 arguments, the `INSTALL_PATH`.

**Note:** For the sake of simplicity, the sample plugin does not actually use the argument values. To run the sample, you can supply any text in place of those arguments.
```
java -jar ta-sdk-sample-1.0.0.jar middleware run myarg1
``` 

Output artifacts are in `output` directory.

Logs are in `logs` directory.

### Run data validator
The TA SDK includes a validation utility that could be used to validate the output artifacts created by a 
plugin. Plugin developers could also use this utility to validate the metadata files that are used to generate 
the recommendations.

To run the data validator:
```
cd target
java -cp ta-sdk-sample-1.0.0.jar com.ibm.ta.sdk.spi.validation.TaValidator [OPTIONS]
```

These options are available to validate the output artifacts created by a plugin:
 -e,--environment <arg>      Validate environment JSON file
 -r,--recommendation <arg>   Validate recommendation JSON file
 -z,--collection <arg>       Validate collection zip file, including directory structure, environment and 
recommendation JSON file


These options are available to validate the metadata files used to generate the recommendations:
 -c,--complexity <arg>       Validate complexity JSON file
 -i,--issue <arg>            Validate issue rule JSON file.
 -t,--target <arg>           Validate target JSON file
