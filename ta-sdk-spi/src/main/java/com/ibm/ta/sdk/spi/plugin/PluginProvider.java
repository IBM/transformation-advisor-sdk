 * processed configuration information in JSON format. After the data collection is completed, <i>assess</i>
 * is ran to analyze the collected configuration data. The final output of <i>assess</i> is a recommendations file
 * containing a list of issues, including details on how to resolve it.

 * <p>TA's datacollector uses the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI) to get all available plug-ins in the
